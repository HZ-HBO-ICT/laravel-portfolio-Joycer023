        <h2>WHY HBO?
        </h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Ever since I was in high school, my ultimate goal was to do a college degree. HBO appeals to me because you have more independence with an HBO study, which is very lovely. There is also a faster pace in the treatment of the study material; I am generally quick to keep up with things, which is nice. At the MBO, I often had to wait until I could continue working, which led to me getting bored at school. HBO also goes deeper into the material that is being treated. I am someone who likes to know the how and why of things.

        <h2> WHY HBO-ICT?
        </h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            My passion for ICT goes back quite a while. My love for ICT started when I was eight years old. I was always inquisitive about how things worked on the computer. For my presentation, I chose the subject of computers. I fully immersed myself in how the computer works and which parts were in it. I liked this so much that my interest in computers and the world wide web developed. Over the years, I have watched many videos about things related to ICT. When I was about 13 years old, I made my first website; this was about my then shared passion; photography. I liked making the website more than photography. When I had to choose in my last year of secondary school, I decided on bookkeeping, So I quickly stopped and started working. Later it gnawed at going to school again, but I never really dared to take the step. By now, I was living together and thought I could no longer go to school. Since I was not enjoying my work, I looked into the possibility of going to school again, because this was, after all, a dream of mine to get my diploma, but I had been out of it for six years. In the meantime, I was working on small courses about networks, and I took out a subscription for Codecademy and broadened my knowledge there. Therefore, making software seems to be an enjoyable daily activity. I don't see this as a job but as a hobby.
